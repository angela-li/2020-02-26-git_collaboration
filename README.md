Git training for collaboration

- `clone`: "downloading" a repository from a remote to our local computer
  - You only really need to do this once, just like the `init` command
- `branch <name>`: create a branch called <name>
  - `checkout <name>` or `switch <name>`: to move `HEAD` (i.e., switch) to that branch
